    // If you only plan on supporting Android 4.0.3 and up, you don't need to include this.
    compile project(':libzxing:zxing-android-legacy')

    // Convenience library to launch the scanning and encoding Activities.
    // It automatically picks the best scanning library from the above two, depending on the
    // Android version and what is available.
    compile project(':libzxing:zxing-integration')
}
